## Workaround:
## onion-grater fails if it cannot bind on the network interface.
## This is the case when networking did not come up, which is the case when
## whonix-firewall.service failed. To make onion-grater
## automatically start after lets says Whonix firewall config was fixed and the
## whonix-firewall.service was restarted.
After=whonix-firewall.service
Requires=whonix-firewall.service
